# Mail-Dadi

**Description**:<br>
For this exercise I made 2 different scripts : **dices.js** and **mail.js**.<br>
<br>
**Usage**:<br>
To use both simply edit the script tags in ```index.html``` (only one must be imported to work).
<br>
<br>


## Mail
This scripts checks if the email submitted by the form is in the ```emailWhiteList``` array.

## Dadi
This scripts generates a random number between 1 and 6 for the user and the ai.<br>
If the player's number is greater than ai's number the player wins, otherwise the ai will win.
